i am trying to hold my breath
let it stay this way
she can not let this moment end
you set off a dream in me
it is getting louder now
can you hear it echoing
you should take my hand
will you share this with meit
all the shine of a tousand spotlights will never be enough
all the stars we steal from the nightsky will never be enough
towers of gold are still too little
these hands could hold the world
the world is trying to take us out of line
we borrow feelings for a time
how do we breath
how do we climb
so we stay is this beautiful mess tonight
we do not have a thing to lose
no matter what they say or do
i do not want nothing more
our love is untouchable
everything is on the wire
the colours turn grey and the lights all fade to black again
we are in over our heads but somehow we make it back again
i should ink my skin with your name
and take my passport out again 
see i could do without a tan on my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
i should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles
maybe you are lovable and maybe you are my snowflake
your eyes turn from green to gray
i will hold you in a cold place in winter
you should never cut your hair because i love the way you flick it off your shoulder
you will never knwo just how beautiful you are to me
but maybe i am jsut in love when you wake me up
would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
would you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way
i love you shrek because we have watched it twelve times
but maybe you are hoping for a fairy tale too
if your dvd breaks you should got a vcr
you flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets
i think you hate the smell of smoke
you always try and get me to stop
you drink as much as me
i will take you to the beach and walk slong the sand
i will make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand
i will carve it like a necklace so the heart falss where your chest is
now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be
you just need to breath to feel my heart against yours now
